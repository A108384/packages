summary    : A low-level library for calling build-backends in `pyproject.toml`-based project
description: |
    This is a low-level library for calling build-backends in pyproject.toml-based project. It provides the basic functionality to help write tooling that generates distribution files from Python projects. If you want a tool that builds Python packages, you'll want to use https://github.com/pypa/build instead. This is an underlying piece for pip, build and other "build frontends" use to call "build backends" within them.
