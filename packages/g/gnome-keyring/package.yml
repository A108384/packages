description: |
    GNOME Keyring is a collection of components in GNOME that store secrets, passwords, keys, certificates and make them available to applications. GNOME Keyring is integrated with the user's login, so that their secret storage can be unlocked when the user logins into their session. GNOME Keyring is based around a standard called PKCS#11, which is a standard way for applications to manage certificates and keys on smart cards or secure storage.
