      The FCEUX concept is that of an &quot;all in one&quot; emulator that offers accurate emulation and the best options for both casual play and a variety of more advanced emulator functions. For pro users, FCEUX offers tools for debugging, rom-hacking, map making, Tool-assisted movies, and Lua scripting

    <p>
      FCEUX is an evolution of the original FCE Ultra emulator. Over time FCE Ultra had separated into many distinct branches.
