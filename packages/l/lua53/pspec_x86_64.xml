        <Summary xml:lang="en">Lightweight programming language</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.
